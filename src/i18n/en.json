  "bio_title": "Biography",
  "bio_paragraph_1": "I am a software developer at Intelligent Writing, focusing on building modern applications with React as my primary technology stack. My journey into IT began in November 2023 when I started learning Java to understand the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming.",
  "bio_paragraph_2": "I studied entirely on my own, driven by curiosity and a desire to create something meaningful. The motivation came while I was working as a copywriter at a sports news website. When that project closed, I was inspired to build my own platform — which eventually became BigSport, a sports media platform I founded and developed as a full-stack engineer.",
  "bio_paragraph_3": "Beyond coding, I am passionate about product thinking — understanding how technology can solve real problems, improve user experience, and scale into something bigger.",
